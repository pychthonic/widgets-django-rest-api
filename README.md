# widgets-django-rest-api


This is a REST API for managing widgets. It will accept GET, POST, PUT,
and DELETE requests. 

To run it locally, use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/pychthonic/widgets-django-rest-api.git
cd widgets-django-rest-api
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

After that, you can first visit the swagger page at localhost:8000/swagger

The current version is 'v1' and the endpoints are:

To get a list of all widgets currently in the database, send a GET
request to /{version}/widgets/

like so:

```
curl --request GET 'localhost:8000/v1/widgets/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

To get information on a specific widget, send a GET request to
/{version}/widgets/{id}

like so:

```
curl --request GET 'localhost:8000/v1/widgets/id/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

To create a new widget with name "new widget", of type "heatMap", send
a POST request to /{verions}/widgets

like so:

```
curl --request POST 'localhost:8000/v1/widgets/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"name": "new widget", "widget_type": "heatMap"}'
```

To change the name of widget with id 3 to "new heat map widget", send a 
PUT request to /{version}/widgets/3 with a request body of
{"name": "new heat map widget"}

like so:

```
curl --request PUT 'localhost:8000/v1/widgets/id/3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"name": "new heat map widget"}'
```

To delete widget with id 3, send a DELETE request to /{version}/widgets/id/3

like so:

```
curl --request DELETE 'localhost:8000/v1/widgets/id/3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

To check what types of widgets are available and currently in use,
send a GET request to /{version}/widgets/types

like so:

```
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8000/v1/widgets/types' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

When building the docker image, the tests in widgets/tests.py will run,
and if any tests fail, the build will fail.

To run the tests, activate a virtual envirnment and run them like so:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 manage.py test
```

You can also run the app locally without a docker container like so:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py test
```
